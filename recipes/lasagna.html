            This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with<br>
            noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes<br>
            well, too.

            Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for<br>
            lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original<br>
            recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is<br>
            posted here will easily serve twelve people.

        </ul>
                
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until<br>
                well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.<br>
                Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and<br>
                2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling<br>
                water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,<br>
                combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br>
                dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the<br>
                ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups<br>
                meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat<br>
                layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil:<br>
                to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not<br>
                touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25<br>
                minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>        </ol>
