        <h6>Published: Jul 20, 2022 by Manuel </h6>

        <p>
            Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6<br>
            hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled<br>
            over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.

                fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to<br>
